<p>However, what makes Loop so remarkable is something that goes beyond codes and programming languages. It is Loop's Magic. Deciphering it means understanding what Loop means to Loopers and the mentors, something that transcends its initial aspirations. On an individual level, Loop — with its personalized methods — is continuously encouraging creativity and engaging participants to define their sense of self in their formative years. They feel seen, heard, and relevant, and that generates both an emotional and intellectual response that helps shape them as human beings.
